                This site was developed using the React library for JavaScript

                The data for this e-commerce was stored in MongoDB considering
                the advantages of employing a non-relational database for this
                project. We made this decision valuing the flexibility of this
                type of database, which makes them easier to adjust or make
                changes. It also presented some advantages when using MongoDB
                Atlas, since it was a faster a simpler way of storing data in
                the cloud. Multimedia elements such as images and icons were
                stored using Supabase.

                The brand logo and icons were designed with Procreate and Adobe
